										With Sustainability as the theme, my group attempted to address the lack of awareness among adolescents on Singapore's susceptibility to food shocks and 
										the importance of self-sustainability. The two main gaps we have identified were that current measures were either purely informative, 
										inconvenient or they exist as a one-off event. Thus, with SPROUT, in collaboration with schools, not only can students experience the 
										cultivation of microgreens in a fun, easy, and accessible manner through the automatic lighting and watering system, they can also gain 
										more knowledge through the lesson tutorials and quizzes on the in-built LCD screen.

									<h2><a id="intern">INTERNSHIP @ SGH 3D PRINTING CENTRE</a></h2>
									<p>A fun & enriching experience</p>
								</header>

								<p>
									During my 16 weeks internship at SGH 3DPC, I had the privilege to work closely with passionate clinicians on cutting-edge projects in the healthcare industry,
									where I harnessed my skills as a product designer to make meaningful impacts. Here are some key highlights from my experience:
									<li>Innovative 3D Printing Solutions: I designed 3D-printed guides and training models that revolutionized the way surgeons visualize and plan their procedures. 
										These tools were useful in improving surgical precision and patient outcomes.</li>
									<li>Customized Healthcare Products: I developed workflows using their modeling software Materialise (Mimics & 3-Matics) to create patient-specific surgical guides and ankle foot orthoses.</li>
									<li>Materials Experimentation: A journey of experimentation, exploring various silicone mold designs and types of silicone rubber resin to achieve the perfect soft tissue texture</li>
								</p>

										<a class="image fit"><img id="myImg3" src="images/Surgical Guides.JPG" alt="" /></a>

									</div>
									<div class="col-6">
										<br>
										<p>From understanding the problems surgeons faced to getting the relevant information regarding the tools' dimensions and operating context, I worked closely with them to design and develop guides.
											These in-house designed guides can reduce the cost and time required to obtain the necessary tools for the operation, increasing the accessibility of such precise equipment to more patients</p>
									</div>

								<div class="row gtr-25">

										<p>This is the Ankle Foot Orthoses I have designed based on the considerations mentioned by the podiatrist. 
											Instead of the existing hand molding method, we experimented with the addictive manufacturing method where different kinds of materials and manufacturing methods were explored to attain the optimal AFO that is strong and long-lasting</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-4">
										<a class="image fit"><img src="images/AFO.JPG" alt="" /></a>

								<p>
									I am glad to be able to play a part in increasing the accessibility of more precise tools to more patients, and giving back to society in such a meaningful way.
									This internship has deepened my passion for shaping a better future in the healthcare industry through science and technology.

								<p> During my summer break in 2023, I was honored to represent SUTD at Stanford University for their International Honours Programme. The campus, the people met, and the memories made were beautiful and memorable.
									Living, studying, and hanging out with these international friends has also allowed me to gain multiple perspectives, as well as new cultural knowledge. 
								</p>
								
								<p>	One of the courses I took was Technological Entrepreneurship, which focuses on equipping students with the skills and knowledge needed to navigate the complex landscape of starting and managing a technology-driven business,
									through working on a mentor-guided project. Along with 4 other members from Italy and Pakistan, we designed a mobile application that acts as a personalized shopping companion, targeting shoppers who already know what to buy and want to save time at the mall.
									Smart search, item comparison, and reservation are some features our app can provide. With E-Mall, it provides users with a catalogue of items from different stores, which changes the way we used to shop (buying only from brands we are aware of).
									This, unfortunately, automatically eliminates local brands that may not be as well-known.
									This unique selling point of our app enables you to access all the possible products you could find within the mall, see the inventory level, and even make reservations through the app itself, increasing in-store shopping efficiency. 
									Such a shopping mobile application is particularly useful in countries like Italy, where most of the shops are local brands that do not have their websites.
									
									<br>
									<br>
									Feel free to check out our pitch deck & the app's wireframe that I have designed using Figma!

									In collaboration with SingHealth and Duke-NUS Medical School, I have created a new and effective method to 
									design a patient-specific sterilizable surgical guide for facial reconstruction surgery using a Fibula. By 
									tapping on free CADing software like Meshmixer, and using a 3D printer with biocompatible resin, surgical 
									cutting guides can be developed in a more accessible and affordable method. This resulted in at least a 50% reduction 
									in both cost and lead time as compared to the existing method.

								<p>
									As part of the mechanical team, I was in charge of designing a housing structure for the portable MRI. Using SolidWorks, I 
									<li>designed in consideration of its highly specific constraints and requirements</li>
									<li>analyze its structures and joints using the Finite Element Analysis tool</li>
									<br>
									It was my first experience designing an industrial product. Being exposed to industrial criteria and standards, it taught me 
									to be detail-oriented and forward-thinking. It was enriching to learn and explore different mechanical elements and components 
									to get the most efficient design. 
								</p>
								<p>
									On the side, our team also participated in the 4-months Accelerating Research & Innovation for SUTD Entrepreneurs (ARISE) Programme 
									where we were mentored by industry leaders to prepare us to pitch to investors for seed funds. We successfully received offers, with 
									one being a 7-figure offer.

								<p>
									During Summer '21, my team designed and built a public interactive installation at Somerset using unwanted paper tubes, aimed to engage 
									and connect youths.
								</p>
								<p>
									Inspired by wind chimes and the xylophone, THE CHIMES features a set of hanging paper tubes supported by a tent-like frame, that produces 
									a range of sounds and colors. By engaging the senses of sight, sound, and touch, THE CHIMES accentuates the idea of 'Play,' in an attempt 
									to reconnect one with their inner child and the feeling of discovery.
								</p>
								<p>
									Hitting the tubes produces different sounds that activate the lights within. The interaction between light and sound blends together one's 
									visual and auditory senses.

									Safe Distancing Park is our proposed new concept for Merlion Park to safely manage its overcrowding issue amidst the Covid-19 situation.
									It moves away from the norm of legislation, using positive feedback loops. We made safe distancing fun through gamification, so as to
									enhance user experience. Through exciting interactions on our platform, photo-worthy seasonal installations, mind-boggling optical illusion, 
									and imaginative drawing floor, our revamped park has something for everyone- from sightseers to active children.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									<h3>Inspiration</h3>
									<br>
									Covid is restrictive but we inspire to change people's perception. The new norm is going to last and we aim to make safe distancing positive and engaging 
									to uplift the morale of people by incorporating interaction and inclusivity. Given the huge popularity of the light festival previously held at Merlion Park, 
									we were inspired to tap on these high-user-responsive interactive installations to direct them around the park.
